Although these solutions cannot always be computed exactly with radicals, they can be computed to any desired degree of accuracy using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or Laguerre method, and in this way they are no different from solutions to polynomial equations of the second, third, or fourth degrees.\n",

      "  * Multiple processors are involved to solve a global problem.\n",

      "  * SIMD (single-instruction-multiple-data) machines incorporate the idea of parallel processing, which use a large number of process- ing units to execute the same instruction on different data.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Modern parallel computers are so-called MIMD (multiple-instruction- multiple-data) machines and can execute different instruction streams in parallel on different data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Shared memory and distributed memory\n",
      "\n",
      "  * One way of categorizing modern parallel computers is to look at the memory configuration.\n",

      "  * In shared memory systems the CPUs share the same address space. Any CPU can access any data in the global memory.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "### Different parallel programming paradigms\n",
      "\n",
      "  * {\\bf Task parallelism:} the work of a global problem can be divided into a number of independent tasks, which rarely need to synchronize. Monte Carlo simulation is one example. Integration is another. However this paradigm is of limited use.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * {\\bf Data parallelism:} use of multiple threads (e.g. one thread per processor) to dissect loops over arrays etc. This paradigm requires a single memory address space. Communication and synchronization between processors are often hidden, thus easy to program. However, the user surrenders much control to a specialized compiler. Examples of data parallelism are compiler-based parallelization and OpenMP directives.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Today's situation of parallel computing\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Distributed memory is the dominant hardware configuration. There is a large diversity in these machines, from MPP (massively parallel processing) systems to clusters of off-the-shelf PCs, which are very cost-effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Message-passing is a mature programming paradigm and widely accepted. It often provides an efficient match to the hardware. It is primarily used for the distributed memory systems, but can also be used on shared memory systems. In these lectures we consider only message-passing for writing parallel programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overhead present in parallel computing\n",

      "  * {\\bf Overhead of communication}.\n",

      "  * Is physically intuitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Allows one to study systems with many degrees of freedom. Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) yield in principle the exact solution to Schr\\\"odinger's equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) is easy to implement but needs a reliable trial wave function, can be difficult to obtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * DMC/GFMC for fermions (spin with half-integer values, electrons, baryons, neutrinos, quarks) has a sign problem. Nature prefers an anti-symmetric wave function. PDF in this case given distribution of random walkers ($p\\ge 0$).\n",
      "\n",
      "  * The solution has a statistical error, which can be large.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * There is a limit for how large systems one can study, DMC needs a huge number of random walkers in order to achieve stable results.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Obtain only the lowest-lying states with a given symmetry. Can get excited states.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Where and why do we use Monte Carlo Methods in Quantum Physics\n",

      "  * Quantum systems with many particles at finite temperature: Path Integral Monte Carlo with applications to dense matter and quantum liquids (phase transitions from normal fluid to superfluid). Strong correlations.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases, method transition from non-linear PDE to Diffusion Monte Carlo as density increases.\n",

It is the distance over which the fluctuations of the microscopic degrees of freedom (for example the position of atoms) are significantly correlated with each other. Usually it is of the order of few interatomic spacings for a solid.\n",

      "  * The correlation length $\\xi$ depends however on external conditions such as pressure and temperature.\n",

      "### Two Scenarios for Phase Transitions\n",
      "\n",
      "  * First order/discontinuous phase transitions: Two or more states on either side of the critical point also coexist exactly at the critical point. As we pass through the critical point we observe a discontinuous behavior of thermodynamical functions. The correlation length is normally finite at the critical point. Phenomena such as hysteris occur, viz. there is a continuation of state below the critical point into one above the critical point. This continuation is metastable so that the system may take a macroscopically long time to readjust. Classical example, melting of ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Second order or continuous transitions: The correlation length diverges at the critical point, fluctuations are correlated over all distance scales, which forces the system to be in a unique critical phase. The two phases on either side of the critical point become identical. Smooth behavior of first derivatives of the partition function, while second derivatives diverge. Strong correlations make a perturbative treatment impossible. Renormalization group theory.\n",
